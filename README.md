#Objective :
To design and implement an interactive Power BI dashboard for Blinkit to track and analyze sales performance, order volume, delivery times, and customer satisfaction KPIs. The objective was to transform raw operational data into actionable insights, enabling management to improve efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance customer experience through data-driven decision-making.


#Top 5 Insights got from this project :

1. Order Volume Trends – Peak orders occur during evenings and weekends, indicating high demand during leisure hours.

2. Top-Performing Categories – Beverages and Snacks contribute the highest revenue share, while some categories like personal care have lower sales penetration.

3. Delivery Performance – 80% of orders are delivered within 30 minutes, but delays are common in high-traffic metro areas.

4. Customer Segmentation – Repeat customers drive 65% of total revenue, highlighting the importance of customer retention programs.

5. Regional Insights – Sales are highest in Tier-1 cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore), while Tier-2 cities show potential for growth with targeted promotions

Vitals KPIs:

1. Total Sales / Revenue – Measures overall revenue generated from customer orders.

2. Total Orders Placed – Tracks the number of orders processed within a selected period.

3. Average Delivery Time – Monitors how quickly orders are fulfilled (e.g., within 10, 20, or 30 minutes).

4. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) – Evaluates customer experience and service quality through feedback ratings.

5. Repeat Customer Rate – Percentage of returning customers vs. new customers, showing customer loyalty and retention.
